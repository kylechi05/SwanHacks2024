# SwanHacks2024: SpreadSim

SpreadSim aims to demonstrate computational epidemiology and how a virus can spread through a population by way of an educational video game. The core technologies are based on the Godot game engine with novel implementations of the A* algorithm to aid in citizen movement and discrete event simulation to determine disease spread. Every citizen in the game is a procedurely generated AI that has it's own education level, immunity, and work schedule causing emergent gameplay for the end user. In addition, all music, sprites, and graphics are entirely custom made.  This game can be used to teach people preventative measures that can be taken to ward off an outbreak in a population and is inspired by UI professor Alberto Segreâ€™s research.
